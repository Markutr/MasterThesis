  abstract = {{Age–period–cohort (APC) models are frequently used to analyze mortality or morbidity rates stratified by age group and period. For the case in which rates are given in different strata, multivariate APC models have been considered only recently. Such models share a set of parameters, for example, the age effects, while the other parameters may vary across strata. We show that differences of strata-specific effects are identifiable. We then propose a Bayesian approach based on smoothing priors to estimate multivariate APC models. This provides an alternative to maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of relative risk in the case of equal intervals and gives useful results even in the case of unequal intervals, where ML estimates have severe artifacts. This is illustrated with data on female mortality in Denmark and Norway and data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality of males in England and Wales, stratified by 3 different areas: Greater London, conurbations excluding Greater London, and nonconurbation areas.}},

  abstract = {The software package BAMP provides a method of analyzing incidence or mortality data on the Lexis diagram, using a Bayesian version of an age-period-cohort model. A hierarchical model is assumed with a binomial model in the first-stage. As smoothing priors for the age, period and cohort parameters random walks of first and second order, with and without an additional unstructured component are available. Unstructured heterogeneity can also be included in the model. In order to evaluate the model fit, posterior deviance, DIC and predictive deviances are computed. By projecting the random walk prior into the future, future death rates can be predicted.},

  abstract = {Abstract Age–period–cohort models are widely used by epidemiologists to analyse trends in disease incidence and mortality. The interpretation of such models is fraught with difficulty in view of the exact linear dependency between the three variables. It is the purpose of this paper to review, compare and contrast some of the more common approaches to this problem based on Poisson regression and a linear model for the log rates. Also the results of using the different approaches on a single series of data on breast cancer incidence among females in Scotland from 1960–1989 are presented for comparison. Recommendations as to the merits and drawbacks of the approaches are also given in the conclusions. Models which are based upon the estimable contrasts such as local curvatures and deviations from linearity are most suitable. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Small area estimation (SAE) is an important endeavor in many fields and is used for resource allocation by both public health and government organizations. Often, complex surveys are carried out within areas, in which case it is common for the data to consist only of the response of interest and an associated sampling weight, reflecting the design. While it is appealing to use spatial smoothing models, and many approaches have been suggested for this endeavor, it is rare for spatial models to incorporate the weighting scheme, leaving the analysis potentially subject to bias. To examine the properties of various approaches to estimation we carry out a simulation study, looking at bias due to both non-response and non-random sampling. We also carry out SAE of smoking prevalence in Washington State, at the zip code level, using data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The computation times for the methods we compare are short, and all approaches are implemented in R using currently available packages.}

  abstract = {Objectives The general educational development (GED) diploma is intended to be equivalent to a high school (HS) credential; however, recent evidence finds that GED recipients have worse health than HS graduates. This study aims to explain the health disadvantage, focusing on three domains: noncognitive skills, health behaviors, and economic factors. Methods We analyze data on 3,119 HS graduates and GED recipients in the NLSY79 who reported their health status at the age of 40. Logistic and ordinal regression models examine whether the three domains account for the GED health disadvantage. Results The GED health disadvantage was jointly explained by lower noncognitive skills, unhealthy behaviors, and adverse economic circumstances, with the latter being particularly important. Conclusions A multipronged approach may be necessary to reduce the GED health disadvantage, including improving noncognitive skills during K–12 education, expanding opportunities for employment and living wage for low-skill workers, and continued focus on improving health behaviors.},
