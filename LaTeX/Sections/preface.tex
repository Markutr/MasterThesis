\section*{Preface}
This thesis is the result of my work in the course \textit{TMA4900 Industrial
Mathematics, Master’s Thesis} at the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology (NTNU), concluding my Master’s degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics at NTNU, specializing in Industrial Mathematics. I extend my greatest thanks to my supervisor Andrea Riebler, as well as my co-supervisor Ingeborg Hem Sørmoen for their excellent guidance, support and encouragement. 

I thank Anna Zajacova (Professor of Sociology, Western University) and Snehalata V. Huzurbazar (Acting Professor of Statistics, Emory University) for starting this project and letting me be part of it. Thank you for the fruitful discussions and comments. Thank you, Anna, for providing me with your sociological expert knowledge regarding backpain which allowed me to investigate prior elicitation as part of this thesis. 

Furthermore, I would also like to thank my fellow students for making my journey at NTNU truly memorable. Finally, I thank my family and Connie for their unwavering support and encouragement in these trying times.
